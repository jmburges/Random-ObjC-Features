These are the slides for my
[talk](http://www.meetup.com/The-Brooklyn-iPhone-and-iPad-Developer-Meetup/events/138137442/)
at the Brooklyn iOS Meetup on September 17th.

Usage
=====

This is a [Reveal.js](http://revealjs.jit.su/ "Reveal.JS Home Page") slideshow.
If you have [npm](https://npmjs.org/ "NPM Homepage") installed then you should
be able to just run `npm install` then `grunt serve` and then head to
`localhost:8000` to view the slides. 

If you don't have npm or grunt, no worries! Just open up `index.html` and
everything will work. That's the beauty of a basic HTML/JS/CSS Slideshow.
